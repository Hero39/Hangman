# Hangman

In this repository I implemented the Hangman game. I created a list with a few
words. The program picks a random word for the game. The player can guess a
word or a letter. With every wrong guess, a part of the gallows. If the gallow
is completed, the player lost. If the player finds the correct word before
the gallows are drawn, the player wins.
